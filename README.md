This repository has 2 useful Matlab scripts for back calculating RDCs (residual dipolar 
couplings) of a protein NMR structure and in comparison to experimental measurements.  
The 1st back calculates RDCs and gives information pertinent to the Saupe order tensor 
and rotational alignment to the media, and the 2nd generates figures with statistical 
information (1,2 sigma lines, Pearson and Q-factor coefficients of the protein amino 
residue matches).  These are calculated and shown for N-H or C-H RDCs.

These 2 scripts were used along with other scripts to create 2 databases of protein 
NMR structures, of size 150 and 39 proteins.  The first also has a version to include 
a restricted set of residues from the deposited NMR structure, such as from a 'well-defined' 
set of amino acids.
